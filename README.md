# Chase's React Context Demo!
---

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

This means that context is a good alternative to Redux if you choose to use it!

So in this quick demo app, I have created the main "Provider.js" file. Of course you can call this whatever you want! But anyway, I've added some comments into it to help explain the steps to get the context api hooked up in your app!

Now there's only 2 components in here (and yes I realize I don't necessarily need context/redux for this). Just pretend this is a huge multiple level app. So my "Store.js" (Store Component) is "embedded" let's say 4 or 5 levels down into my app. 

Instead of passing props around everywhere, we're gonna hook up the context API and I promise you will love how easy and effective it is to use!

So again, look at the Provider.js and the Store.js file and you can get an idea of how to implement this awesome feature into your project!
